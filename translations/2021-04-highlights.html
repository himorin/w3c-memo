	  alt="">
	  
	  <p>過去14ヶ月で、世界全体が加速度的に物理的会合からオンラインへ移行してきました。これは興奮する事実ですが、公衆衛生上の悪夢による副産物でもあり心配事でもあります。これの重要な位置にウェブがあることはさまざまな統計が示すところです。</p>
	  <p>社会に対して移動や物理的接触が制限されるという変化が加わる中で、全世界にとってウェブがなくてはならない重要な技術基盤となってきています。オンラインでの通販・学習・診療、新しい方式でのビジネス運営、娯楽、家族や友人と繋がり続けることなどにどれにおいても、この流れは加速していくでしょう。</p>
	  <p>技術の利用の浸透に伴い、世界の技術基盤におけるわれわれの行っている相互可用性の担保が重要となります。（これには古くからのウェブと中国におけるミニアプリ基盤のような新しいものの両方を含みます）</p>
	  <p>これらの変化はW3Cにとっても、将来に向けたビジョンや戦略や、ダイバーシティや社会参画についてより注力すること、そして仕様策定プロセスの改善など、組織的変革につながるものでした。</p>

	  <h3 id="nexus">W3Cは3つの軸を結んで活動しています: コア技術、産業要求、社会要求</h3>

	  <p>以前よりまして、W3Cの活動は物理からバーチャルへの転換に直接かかわるようになりました（<a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/01/pressrelease-webrtc-rec.html.en">WebRTC 仕様が最近勧告化</a>など）。
			そして、活動成果も変化する社会からの要求をみたす、社会にとって重要な問題への解決策に沿う、それらをウェブのレベルで適用する、などとともに、セキュリティー・プライバシーとより広いウェブの非集権化・ウェブでの決済・パフォーマンス・メディア・アクセシビリティー・国際化についての挑戦的な課題を解決しつつ相互可用性を担保するというような方向に向かっています。</p>
	  
	  <h3 id="focus">このレポートについて</h3>
	  <img src="https://www.w3.org/comm/assets/icons/magnifier.png" alt="">
	  
	  <p>W3Cの活動が過去1年間の危機における挑戦や次に来るべき解決策の提供に対して必須なものであったことを誇りに考えます。このレポートは、ウェブ基盤を拡張しその発展と強みを広げる活動のまとめであり、科学的な協働や発見を加速しつづける、家族・友人をつなぐ場になる、オンラインで学習し技術を高める手段になる、活発なビジネスを行う、などのツールとなり続けるための活動のまとめです。</p>
	  
	  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/">39このワーキンググループと10このインタレストグループ</a>の活動によるW3Cのウェブ標準の策定や、ガイドライン・解説文書の作成により、その<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">使命</a>を遂行しています。</p>

	  <p>全体で<a href="https://w3c.github.io/spec-dashboard/report.html">287個の仕様</a>にわたる多くの活動は、GitHub上のワークスペースにおいて全体を通して均質で<a href="https://w3c.github.io/validate-repos/report.html">良質な監視と管理</a>の元で遂行されています。</p>

	  <h3 id="pipeline">Identifying promising standardization
	  areas</h3>
	  <img src="https://www.w3.org/comm/assets/icons/lightbulb.png" alt="">
	  
          <p>W3C uses a variety of mechanisms to engage community
            discussion on future Web standards: conversations with the
            Membership, liaising with other standards bodies, tracking
            the activity of thousands of participants in
            over <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/groups/">350
            W3C community groups</a>, and hosting W3C Workshops. There
            are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team works to
            identifying promising topics for standardization and
            invites public participation.</p>
	  <p><a href="/2003/08/Workshops/archive">Workshops</a> bring
	    communities together around presentations, panels,
	    breakouts, and virtual "hallway" sessions to spur
	    collaboration on new work
	    areas. While <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/meetings/continuity.html#workshops">switching
	    to virtual</a> entails a change in mode and some
	    re-setting of schedules, we envision that distributed
	    meetings can be even more accessible and globally
	    participatory.</p>

          <p>The <a href="/Strategy/Funnel">Strategy incubation
            pipeline</a> documents the exploration of potential new
            work in phases of
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215578">Incubation</a>
              and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215579">Evaluation</a>,
              and eventually in the
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215580">chartering</a>
            stages of new standards groups. The W3C Strategy Team's
            incubation pipeline is a GitHub Project where new area are
            issues represented by “cards” which move through the
            columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start
            in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215576">Exploration</a>
            and move towards
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215580">Chartering</a>, or move out of the pipeline.</p>
	  
          <p><strong>Public input is welcome at any stage</strong> but
            particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C
            identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant
            standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and
            indicate interest in participating in its standardization,
            and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate
            scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall
            standardization process.</p>

          <p class="desc">W3C's payments standards enable a streamlined
              checkout process, giving a consistent user experience
              across the Web with lower front-end development costs
              for merchants. Users can store and reuse
            information and more quickly and accurately complete

	  <h4 id="payment-request">Payment Request API</h4>
	  <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/payments">Web
	    Payments Working Group</a> plans to advance Payment
	    Request API 1.0 to Proposed Recommendation once
	    discussions with the Privacy Interest Group have completed
	    on whether to maintain a feature related to address
	    collection that has raised privacy concerns.</p>

	  <h4 id="spc">Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC)</h4>
	  <p>In March, Stripe published
	  the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2021/Talks/spc-pilot-202103.pdf">results
	  of their experiment with "Secure Payment Confirmation."</a>
	  The experiment tested the hypothesis that users will prefer
	  Web Authentication to one-time passwords within what is
	  called the "challenge flow" of the EMV 3-D Secure
	  protocol. The experiment showed that, <strong>with SPC,
	  users completed 8% more purchases and authentication was
	  three times faster than one time passwords. In addition,
	  there was negligible fraud</strong> with SPC (similar to one
	  time passwords). You can
	  read <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/wpwg/2021/03/26/secure-payment-confirmation-stripe-experiment-and-next-steps/">more</a>
	  on this in the Web Payments working group blog.</p>
	  <p>SPC as it was used in the Stripe pilot offers a
	  "low-friction" authentication flow during a transaction, but
	  the industry is also interested in "zero friction" risk
	  assessment flows. Many of today's approaches involve cookies
	  and browser fingerprinting. In light of changes to the
	  browser, the Working Group (and
	  the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/securepay">Web Payment
	  Security Interest Group</a>) are looking into alternative
	  approaches that are also more privacy-protecting.</p>

	  <h4 id="merchant">Merchant Business Group</h4>
	  <p>The
	  W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/bg/merchantbg">Merchant
	  Business Group</a> –which launched last September as a
	  non-technical forum where participants discuss merchant

          <p class="desc">The Web is the universal publishing
            platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web,
            and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing. Topic of
            particular focus
            of <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/">Publishing@W3C</a>
            include typography and layout, accessibility, usability,

            print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the
            diverse publishing community represented in the groups
            consist of the traditional "trade" publishers, ebook
            reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of

	  <h4 id="epub3">EPUB 3 Working Group</h4>
	  <p>W3C launched
	    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/epub">EPUB&nbsp;3
	    Working Group</a> in September 2020 to maintain, develop
	    and clarify the EPUB&nbsp;3 family of specifications, to
	    represent the EPUB community in W3C, and to support
	    EPUB&nbsp;3 content creators and consumers. An important
	    outcome of the group is to significantly increase the
	    interoperability of EPUB publications and reading
	    systems.</p>
	  
	  <p>The rigorous W3C process of testing will make a cleaner,
	    clearer, more easily-implemented EPUB&nbsp;3
	    specification. That work has begun with more systematic
	    testing and accompanying improvements on the standard in
	    the form of clarifications, better conformance
	    statements.</p>

	  <p>In order to make EPUB more readable, and to remove
	    duplications and redundancies, the group has made significant
	    editorial improvements without changing any of the technical
	    requirements of EPUB&nbsp;3.2. You can read more about
	    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/8859">EPUB&nbsp;3.3</a>

	      groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and

	      needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and

	    <p>What we know as CSS is actually
	      a <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/">collection</a> of

	  <div class="desc">
	  <p>In 2006, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the
	    Rights of Persons with Disabilities which reaffirmed that
	    all persons with all types of disabilities should be able
	    to enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The
	    Convention defined access to information, including web
	    and digital content, as a human right. Web accessibility
	    is key for equal access, opportunity and participation for
	    all.</p>

	  <p>The Web
	    Consortium’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web
	    Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>, launched in 1997,
	    develops technical specifications and outreach and
	    training materials that promote awareness and
	    implementation of web accessibility. <abbr title="Web
	    Accessibility
	    Initiative">WAI</abbr>’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web
	    Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> is regarded as
	    the authoritative international standard for Web
	    accessibility, and has been adopted or referenced by many
	    governments around the world.</p>

	  <p>As the complexity of the Web increases, as technologies
	    as diverse as digital publishing and virtual reality
	    converge onto the Web, the need for up-to-date
	    accessibility support in advanced technologies is
	    increasing. WAI supports
	    W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission.html#principles">Web
	    for All</a> mission, and helps ensure a cohesive program
	    of coordinated accessibility activities, distributed
	    across all areas of W3C.</p>

	      2021, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG&nbsp;2.2</a>
	      is receiving a second round of wide review. The
	      specification adds more accessibility requirements for
	      people with cognitive and learning disabilities, people
	      with low vision, and mobile accessibility.</li>
	    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/01/wcag-3-fpwd/">WCAG&nbsp;3.0</a>
		was published for review as a first public working
