	  <p>社会に全世界的パンデミック状態の影響が続く中、ウェブとW3C標準の利用が拡大しています。移動や物理的接触が制約される中、全世界にとってウェブがなくてはならない重要な技術基盤となっています。オンライン通販、家庭での学習、遠隔診療、新しい方式でのビジネス運営、娯楽、そして家族や友人とつながり続けるためなどに利用されています。</p>
	  <p>さまざまな企業がウェブ技術を拡張する必要性をもってW3Cに加入してきています。この中には、バーチャルに移行するために直接利用される技術や、プライバシーやウェブの非集権化をより進めるための課題など社会変革に必要とされる技術もあります。</p>
	  
	  <h3 id="re-create">このレポートについて</h3>
	  
	  <p>ウェブの未来を作るというW3Cの活動が、公衆保健上の緊急事態に世界が直面している中での挑戦や次に来るべき解決策の提供に対して必須のものであったことを誇りに考えます。</p>
	  <p>このレポートは、ウェブ基盤を拡張しその発展と強みを広げる活動のまとめであり、科学的な協働や発見を加速しつづける、家族・友人をつなぐ場になる、オンラインで学習し技術を高める手段になる、活発なビジネスを行う、などのツールとなり続けるための活動のまとめです。</p>
	  
	  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/">42このワーキンググループと10個のインタレストグループ</a>の活動によるW3Cのウェブ標準の策定や、ガイドライン・解説文書の作成により、その<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">使命</a>を遂行しています。</p>

	  <p>全体で<a href="https://w3c.github.io/spec-dashboard/report.html">299個の仕様</a>にわたる多くの活動は、GitHub上のワークスペースにおいて全体を通して均質で<a href="https://w3c.github.io/validate-repos/report.html">良質な監視と管理</a>の元で行われています。W3Cの勧告やW3Cが公開するその他の種類の文書は<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">全ての標準と草案</a>のページにリストされています。</p>

	  <h3 id="pipeline">Identifying promising standardization
	  areas</h3>
	  <img src="https://www.w3.org/comm/assets/icons/lightbulb.png" alt="">
	  
          <p>W3C uses a variety of mechanisms to engage community
            discussion on future Web standards: conversations with the
            Membership, liaising with other standards bodies, tracking
            the activity of thousands of participants in
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/groups/">360
            W3C community groups</a>, and hosting W3C Workshops. There
            are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team works to
            identifying promising topics for standardization and
            invites public participation.</p>
	  
	  <h3 id="workshops">W3C Workshops</h3>
	  <p><a href="/2003/08/Workshops/archive">W3C Workshops</a>
	    bring communities together around presentations, panels,
	    breakouts, and virtual "hallway" sessions to spur
	    collaboration on new work
	    areas. While <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/meetings/continuity.html#workshops">switching
	    to virtual</a> entailed a change in mode and some
	    re-setting of schedules, we committed to making
	    distributed meetings even more accessible and globally
	    participatory. We <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9142">announced</a>
	    last July that all W3C Workshops are to include standard
	    accessibility accommodations such as English captions on
	    pre-recorded presentations, real-time captioning during
	    live sessions, and ASL or other sign language where
	    possible upon request.</p>

	  <h3 id="funnel">W3C Strategy funnel</h3>
          <p>The <a href="/Strategy/Funnel">Strategy incubation
            pipeline</a> documents the exploration of potential new
            work in phases of
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215578">Incubation</a>
              and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215579">Evaluation</a>,
              and eventually in the
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215580">chartering</a>
            stages of new standards groups. The W3C Strategy Team's
            incubation pipeline is a GitHub Project where new area are
            issues represented by “cards” which move through the
            columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start
            in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215576">Exploration</a>
            and move towards
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215580">Chartering</a>, or move out of the pipeline.</p>
	  
          <p><strong>Public input is welcome at any stage</strong> but
            particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C
            identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant
            standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and
            indicate interest in participating in its standardization,
            and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate
            scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall
            standardization process.</p>

	  <h4 id="spc">Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC)</h4>
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/secure-payment-confirmation">Secure
	    Payment Confirmation</a> remains the focus of

	    Payments Working Group</a> and
	  <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/securepay">Web Payment
	    Security Interest Group</a>. Spurred by the
	    encouraging <a href="http://www.w3.org/2021/Talks/spc-pilot-202103.pdf">results</a>
	    of the Stripe experiment in March which showed that users
	    completed <strong>8% more purchases, that authentication
	    was three times faster than one time passwords, and with
	    negligible fraud</strong>:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The working group prioritized development
	    of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/secure-payment-confirmation/blob/main/scope.md">use
	    cases</a>, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/secure-payment-confirmation/blob/main/requirements.md">requirements</a>,
	    and
	    an <a href="https://w3c.github.io/secure-payment-confirmation/">API
	    for SPC</a>.</li>
	    <li>The interest group
	      has been discussing related compliance topics, resulting in the
	    draft <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wpsig/blob/gh-pages/spc-psd2.md">using
	    SPC to fulfill PSD2 requirements for SCA and dynamic
	    linking</a>. This work aims to establish SPC as a valuable tool (in
	    conjunction with other protocols) for payment service
	    providers and banks to fulfill regulatory
	      requirements.</li>
	  </ul>
	    <p>W3C Members Airbnb and Adyen decided to
	    experiment with SPC too, and Stripe will conduct a second
	      experiment.</p>
	  <p>In October, EMVCo <a href="https://www.emvco.com/emvco_document/emvco-publishes-emv-3-d-secure-2-3-to-support-more-secure-and-convenient-e-commerce-authentication/">announced</a> support for SPC in version 2.3 of the
	    EMV® 3-D Secure protocol, which will help improve
	    end-to-end interoperability and security of card payments
	    on the Web.</p>

	  <p>Privacy and security – integral to human rights and

	  <p>Only a quarter of the world's population of
            almost 8 billion speaks English, and yet over 50% of
            online content is written in that one language. Those
            whose voice and language are not included on the Web are
            marginalized and excluded. They do not receive the
            economic, educational or democratic benefits of the Web
            and by not having their presence and participation, we
            lose the potential of the Web to reflect the full richness
            of the world.</p>
	  
          <p>The Web Consortium launched

            Activity (i18n)</a> in 1998 to make the Web truly 'world
            wide'. For the Web to truly work for stakeholders all
            around the world engaging with content in various
            languages, there must be a collaboration of language
            experts, Web site designers, developers, and vendors who
            are active in moving the Web forward. We will only be able
            to connect all communities that share a language when the
