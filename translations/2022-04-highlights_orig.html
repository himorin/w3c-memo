	<section>
	  <h3 id="benefit">The work of the Web Consortium benefits millions</h3>
	  <img src="https://www.w3.org/comm/assets/icons/magnifier.png"
	  alt="">

	  <p>We are proud to put the web standards into the web, and
	  that our work is benefitting millions. The web, which just
	  turned 33 this year has been the ultimate tool of resilience
	  for the world as the impact of the global pandemic continues
	  to be a weighty blow to society. Perhaps the most crucial
	  role the web played during the pandemic was allowing
	  families and friends to remain connected. It has also been
	  essential in enabling remote learning, making vaccine
	  appointments, but also online shopping, and
	  entertainment. It has countless businesses stay afloat. All
	  of industry has been substantially aided by the web during
	  the age of Covid. By the same token, it has made it possible
	  for workers across all industries to interact if not
	  perfectly, at least in a manner that allowed most to remain
	  productive. Web access kept millions employed, no doubt
	  preventing a full-on economic depression.</p>

	  <h3 id="needs">Greater usage, greater needs</h3>
	  
	  <p>As the usage of the web intensifies, the needs for web
	  technologies and web standards become greater. More
	  organizations become W3C members with requests to help with
	  their business and societal needs and we want to shepherd
	  the future of the web. We must not take the web for
	  granted. It can do more. It can be more. And it will take a
	  collaborative effort to ensure the web becomes more
	  accessible to people around the world, more secure, and can
	  function as the engine to fuel growth in key parts of
	  economy and society.</p>
	  
	  <h3 id="specs">Key figures representing our work</h3>
	  
	  <p>We are proud that W3C's work continues to be essential to
            the ways in which our world is meeting the challenge of
            the health crisis while working on the solutions for the
            web of the future.</p>
	  <p>This report highlights recent work to enhance the web and
            innovate for its growth and strength.</p>
	  
	  <p>That work is conducted
	      by <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/">43 working
	      groups and 9 interest groups</a> which enable W3C to
	      pursue its
	      <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">mission</a>
	    through the creation of web standards, guidelines, and
	    other specifications and supporting documents.</p>

	  <p>The work of the Consortium has increased significantly since our last report: 
	      <a href="https://w3c.github.io/spec-dashboard/report.html">345
	      specifications</a> are in active development, 174 of
	      which aim to reach the status of W3C Recommendation (web
	      standard). W3C Recommendations and other types of
	      specifications and guidelines are published daily
	      on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">all Standards and
	      Drafts</a>.</p>

	  <h3 id="pipeline">Identifying promising standardization
	  areas</h3>
	  <img src="https://www.w3.org/comm/assets/icons/lightbulb.png" alt="">
	  
          <p>W3C uses a variety of mechanisms to engage community
            discussion on future Web standards: conversations with the
            Membership, liaising with other standards bodies, tracking
            the activity of thousands of participants in
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/groups/">375
            W3C community groups</a>, and hosting W3C Workshops. There
            are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team works to
            identify promising topics for standardization and
            invites public participation.</p>
	  
	  <h3 id="workshops">W3C Workshops</h3>
	  <p><a href="/2003/08/Workshops/archive">W3C Workshops</a>
	    bring communities together around presentations, panels,
	    breakouts, and virtual "hallway" sessions to spur
	    collaboration on new work
	    areas. While <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/meetings/continuity.html#workshops">switching
	    to virtual</a> entailed a change in mode and some
	    re-setting of schedules, we committed to making
	    distributed meetings even more accessible and globally
	    participatory. We <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9142">announced</a>
	    last July that all W3C Workshops are to include standard
	    accessibility accommodations such as English captions on
	    pre-recorded presentations, real-time captioning during
	    live sessions, and ASL or other sign language where
	    possible upon request.</p>

	  <h3 id="funnel">W3C strategy funnel</h3>
          <p>The <a href="/Strategy/Funnel">Strategy incubation
            pipeline</a> documents the exploration of potential new
            work in phases of
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215578">Incubation</a>
              and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215579">Evaluation</a>,
              and eventually in the
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215580">chartering</a>
            stages of new standards groups. The W3C Strategy Team's
            incubation pipeline is a GitHub Project where new area are
            issues represented by “cards” which move through the
            columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start
            in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215576">Exploration</a>
            and move towards
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215580">Chartering</a>,
            or move out of the pipeline.</p>
	  
          <p><strong>Public input is welcome at any stage</strong> but
            particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C
            identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant
            standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and
            indicate interest in participating in its standardization,
            and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate
            scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall
            standardization process.</p>
	  <h3 id="advance">Advance notice of work in progress</h3>
	  <p>W3C may begin work on a Working Group or Interest Group
	    charter at any time. When this is the case, the team
	    informs the W3C Members and
	    the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/">public</a>,
	    aiming to raise awareness, even if no formal proposal is
	    yet available, and welcome feedback.</p>
	  <p>There is work in progress on charters for the following
	    groups:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2022Mar/0012.html">RDF-star

	      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/browser-tools-testing">Browser
	      Testing and Tools Working Group</a> aims to create
	      technologies for automating web browsers, with a focus
	      to enabling automated testing of web applications
	      running inside those browsers while accounting for
	      differences between browser engines.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">WebDriver</a>
	      became a W3C recommendation in 2018, providing an
	      HTTP-based protocol for simulating user interaction with
	      a website, executing a script, in order to provide
	      end-to-end testing and to make writing tests very easy
	      in a wide variety of programming languages.</p>
	    <p>But when automation tools are tied to specific
	    browsers, developers have to decide whether to opt for
	    advanced features or cross-browser support and that's a
	    problem for the open web. The group is
	    developing
	    a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/">2nd version
	    of WebDriver</a>, because it is important for the health
	    of the Web to give the browser automation ecosystem a basis in standards. This version aims to be able to observe
	    internal state changes happening in the browser, much as
	    developer tools do, and to address the non-determinism
	    that can be introduced by modern web applications that use
	      scripts which might invoke network requests.</p>
	    <p>The group also develops WebDriver
	    <abbr title="bidirectional">BiDi</abbr>, a slightly
	    lower-level protocol, to send events directly to the
	    automation tool, rather than only respond to commands.</p>

	    <p>Data, information, knowledge are at the heart of the
	    web. Many W3C work groups are active to respond to high
	    interest in knowledge graphs, digital transformation, data
	    markets and data spaces in general. The ever-increasing
	    sources of open linked data, the rise of the Internet of
	    Things, of Big Data, as well as the opportunities around
	    Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and
	    reasoning, all account for the greater need for
	    flexibility and adapting to change, for ways to create and
	    sustain interoperable data services for suppliers and
	    consumers.</p>
	    <p>W3C has decades of experience, a mature and extensive
	    suite of web standards and vocabularies relating to data
	    and knowledge, linking data or things using URIs and names
	    that can be dereferenced to get further information, and
	    included as links to other data.</p>

	  <p>W3C Members and the public have been recently informed of

	  in progress to create a charter for a RDF-star Working
	  Group</a>, with a primary mission to extend a set of RDF and
	  SPARQL recommendations, with the ability to concisely
	  represent and query statements about statements.</p>

	  <p>In addition, another group is being set
	  up: <a href="https://w3c.github.io/rch-wg-charter/">RDF
	  Dataset Canonicalization and Hash Working Group</a>. The
	  advance notice sent a year ago generated much conversation
	  in the community which resulted in renaming the group and
	  adapting its proposed scope. The mission of the group would
	  be to define a standard to uniquely and deterministically
	  calculate a hash of RDF Datasets for use cases such as
	  Detecting changes in Datasets, and pave the way for digital
	  signature. The work will include defining RDF Dataset
	  Canonicalization algorithms.</p>

	  <p>Privacy and security – integral to human rights and
	    civil liberties – have long been important in the Web
	    Consortium's agenda. For example, our work has been
	    instrumental in improving Web security through the
	    development of authentication technologies that can
	    replace weak passwords and reduce the threats of phishing
	    and other attacks.</p>
	  
	  <p>However, users rightly fear the misuse
	    of their personal data and being tracked online, including
	    browser fingerprinting, the spread of disinformation, and
	    other online harms. These are difficult and urgent
	    challenges. We have begun discussions about how to help

	  <p>Only a quarter of the world's population of
            almost 8 billion speaks English, and yet over 50% of
            online content is written in that one language. Those
            whose voice and language are not included on the Web are
            marginalized and excluded. They do not receive the
            economic, educational or democratic benefits of the Web
            and by not having their presence and participation, we
            lose the potential of the Web to reflect the full richness
            of the world.</p>
	  
          <p>The Web Consortium launched
            the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/">Internationalization
            Activity (i18n)</a> in 1998 to make the Web truly 'world
            wide'. For the Web to truly work for stakeholders all
            around the world engaging with content in various
            languages, there must be a collaboration of language
            experts, Web site designers, developers, and vendors who
            are active in moving the Web forward. We will only be able
            to connect all communities that share a language when the
            Web supports all the world's languages and international
            typography.</p>
