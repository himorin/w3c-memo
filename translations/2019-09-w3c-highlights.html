          title="pipeline of innovations for the Web"><img style="max-width:25%" src="../../Talks/ac-slides/ac2019-jeff-ceo/pipeline-2019.png"
            alt="Pipeline of innovation for the Web [Lightbulb design credit: Freepik]"></a>
        <p>This report highlights recent work of enhancement of the
        existing landscape of the Web platform and innovation for the
        growth and strength of the Web.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities">33
	    working groups and a dozen interest groups</a> enable W3C to
	  pursue its mission through the creation of Web standards,
	  guidelines, and supporting materials. We track the tremendous
	  work done across the Consortium through homogeneous
	  work-spaces in Github which
	  enables <a href="https://w3c.github.io/validate-repos/report.html">better
	    monitoring and management</a>.</p>
	
	<p>We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering
	numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of
	change for the Web platform:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request
	    API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on
	    work.</li>
	  <li>In the last year
	    we <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/04/pressrelease-wps.html.en">chartered
	    the Web Payment Security Interest Group</a>.</li>
	  <li>In the last year
	    we <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2019May/0005.html">chartered
	    the Web Media Working Group</a>
	    with <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/05/media-wg-charter.html#deliverables">7
	    specifications</a> for next generation Media support on
	    the Web.</li>
	  <li>We
	    have <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2019Sep/0006.html">Accessibility
	    Guidelines under W3C Member review</a> which includes Silver, a new approach.</li>
	  <li>We
	    have just launched the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2019Sep/0002.html">Decentralized
            Identifier Working Group</a> which has tremendous potential
	    because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier
	    that is globally unique, resolveable with high
	    availability, and cryptographically verifiable.</li>
	  <li>We
	    have <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2019Jun/0009.html">Privacy
	    IG (PING) under W3C Member review</a> which strengthens
	    our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and
	    function.</li>
	  <li>We have a new CSS
	    charter <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2019Aug/0015.html">under
	      W3C Member review</a> which maps the group's work for the
	    next three years.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In this period, W3C and the WHATWG
	  have <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7753">succesfully
	  completed</a> the negotiation of a Memorandum of
	  Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having
	  two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is
	  generally harmful for the Web
	  community. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU.html">MOU</a>,
	  signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to
	  collaborate on the development of a single authoritative
	  version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C
	  subsequently <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2019Jun/0001.html">rechartered
	  the HTML Working Group</a> to assist the W3C community in
	  raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM
	  specifications, and for the production of W3C
	  Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts. </p>

	<p>As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking
	  for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called
	  "evergreen recommendations" or "living standards" aim
	  to <strong>track continuous development (and maintenance) of
	    features</strong>, on a feature-by-feature basis, while
	  getting review and patent commitments.</p>
	
        <p>We see the maturation and further development of an
          incredible number of new technologies coming to the
          Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the
          vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of
          the report illustrates.</p>
	
        <h2 id="funnel">Future Web Standards</h2>
        <p>W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the
          community thinks could become good future Web
          standards. These include discussions with the Membership,
          discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of
          thousands of participants in
          over <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/groups/">300
            community groups</a>, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of
          good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying
          promising topics and invites public participation.</p>

        <p>The Strategy Funnel documents the staff's exploration of
          potential new work at various phases: <em>Exploration and
            Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to
            the chartering</em> of a new standards
          group. The <a href="/Strategy/Funnel">Funnel</a> view is a
          GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by
          “cards” which move through the columns, usually from left to
          right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards
          Chartering, or move out of the funnel.</p>

        <p><strong>Public input is welcome at any stage</strong> but
          particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C
          identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant
          standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and
          indicate interest in participating in its standardization,
          and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate
          scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall
          standardization process.</p>

        <p>Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a
          number of groups, and started discussion on many more:</p>

          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-handler/">Payment
            Handler API</a> and its implementation (currently in
          Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other
          browsers. Recently, <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/wpwg/2019/04/15/april-2019-face-to-face-meeting-recap/#secure-card-payments">Mastercard
            demonstrated the use of Payment Request API</a> to carry out
          EMVCo's Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol
          whose <a href="https://github.com/w3c/src/wiki">payment
            method definition</a> is being developed with active
          participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and
          Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in
          merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request
          API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment
          method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on
          the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or
          of proprietary alternatives.</p>

	  technical specifications in order to increase compatibility
	  among different technologies, such as:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate?</li>
	  <li>The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in
	    Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What
	    is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what

        <p>To <strong>create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles
            and other devices allowed to connect to the

            W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/auto/wg/">Automotive
            Working Group</a> is delivering a service specification to
            expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature,
            fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vehicle-information-service/">
            Vehicle Information Service Specification</a> (VISS),
            which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more
            implementations across the industry. It provides the
            access method to a common data model for all the vehicle
            signals –presently encapsulating a thousand or so
            different data elements– and will be growing to accommodate
            the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver
            assist technologies and electrification.</p>

	<p>The group is already working on a successor to VISS,
	  leveraging the underlying data model and
	  the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/2019/SUBM-viwi-protocol-20190718/">VIWI
	    submission</a> from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of
	  accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm
	  for other automotive needs including location-based services,
	  media, notifications and caching content.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/autowebplatform/">Automotive
            and Web Platform Business Group</a> acts as an incubator
          for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is
          using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and
          off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the
          wealth of information that W3C's auto signals standard
          exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners,
          insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers
          and owners, service providers and others. In addition to
          components needed for data sampling and edge computing,
          capturing user and owner consent, information collection
          methods and handling of data are in scope.</p>

        <p>CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS
          Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of
          CSS users: the publishing industry and application
          developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by
          the <em>Publishing groups</em> and the <em>Web Platform
            Working Group</em>. The former requires things
          like <b>better pagination support and advanced font
            handling</b>, the latter needs <b>intelligent (and fast!)
            scrolling and animations</b>.</p>
	
        <p>What we know as CSS is actually
          a <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/">collection</a> of
          almost a hundred specifications, referred to
          as <b>‘modules’</b>. The current state of CSS is defined by
          a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/">snapshot</a>, updated
          once a year. The group also publishes
          an <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/indexes/">index</a>
          defining every term defined by CSS specifications.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Fonts/WG/">Web Fonts
            Working Group</a> develops specifications that allow the
          interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web,
          with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as
          maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.</p>
	<p>Recent and ongoing work includes:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have
	    demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where
	    a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and
	    the client can query the full repertoire and request
	    additional subsets on-the-fly.</li>
	  <li>In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in
	    WOFF&nbsp;2 was extended
	    to <a href="https://fonts.gstatic.com/experimental/incxfer_demo">support
	      shared dictionaries and patch update</a>.</li>
	  <li>Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot
	    discussion topic.</li>
	  <li>The group will meet
	    at <a href="https://www.atypi.org/conferences/tokyo-2019">ATypi
	      2019</a> in Japan, to gather requirements from the
	    international typography community.</li>
	  <li>The group will first produce a report summarizing the
	    strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2
	    2020.</li>

        <p> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/?title=svg">All SVG specifications</a>
        </p>
        <p>SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web
          Platform.
          The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/">SVG Working
            Group</a> focuses on aligning the SVG&bnsp;2.0 specification
          with browser implementations, having split the specification
          into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking
          2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased
          integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage
          analysis.</p>
	
	<p>The Working Group
	  was <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2019Mar/0008.html">rechartered</a>
	  in March 2019. A new work item concerns native
	  (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector
	  graphics format.</p>

        <h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/audio/">Web Audio
            Working Group</a> was extended to finish its work on
            the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/">Web Audio
            API</a>, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by
            year end. The specification enables <b>synthesizing audio
            in the browser</b>. Audio operations are performed with
            audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular
            audio routing graph. Multiple sources — with different
            types of channel layout — are supported. This modular
            design provides the flexibility to create complex audio
            functions with dynamic effects.</p>
	
        <p>The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete
          and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started
          on the next version, and new features are being incubated in
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/audio-comgp/">Audio

        <p> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/?title=webassembly">All
            WebAssembly specifications</a> </p>
        <p>WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being
            a <b>virtual machine and execution environment</b>
            enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is
            deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The
            specification will soon reach Candidate
            Recommendation.</p>
        <p>WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load
          time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for
          existing code bases. While it has a small number of native
          types, much of the performance increase relative to
          Javascript derives from its use of consistent
          typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for
          compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for
          compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing
          while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API
          access all occurs through accompanying Javascript
          libraries -- the security model is identical to that of
          Javascript.</p>
        <p>Requirements gathering and language development occur in
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/">Community
            Group</a> while
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wasm/">Working Group</a>

        <h3 class="clear" id="testing">Testing</h3>

        <p>Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions;</li>
          <li>Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by
            helping vendors to detect bugs in their products;</li>
          <li>Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and
            deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these
            tests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="btt">Browser Testing and Tools</h4>

	<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/testing/browser/">Browser
	    Testing and Tools Working Group</a> is
	    developing <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/">WebDriver

	    Recommendation
	    of <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2018/06/webdriver-recommendation/">WebDriver</a>. WebDriver
	    acts as a remote control interface that enables
	    introspection and control of user agents, provides a
	    platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for
	    out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior
	    of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using
	    the browser.</p>

        <p>Data is increasingly important for all organizations,
          especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a
          mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data
          that were developed over two decades of experience, with
          plans for further work on making it easier for developers to
          work with graph data and knowledge graphs.</p>

	<p>Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things,
	the ability to dereference these URIs to get further
	information and to include links to other data. There are
	ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as
	well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and
	consumers of those services.</p>

	<p>The digital transformation of industry is seeking to
	exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate
	businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and
	value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the
	office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support
	enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the
	strategic importance of data to modern businesses.</p>

	<p>Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular
	databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and
	data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We're now in
	midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled
	directed links between them. Graph data is:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations</li>
	  <li>More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources</li>
	  <li>Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving</li>
	</ul>

        <p>In the wake of the
            recent <a href="https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/">W3C
            Workshop on Graph Data</a> we are in the process of
            launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to
            provide a business perspective with use cases and
            requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and
            liaisons with external organizations.</p>

        <p>Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online
          and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web
          reaches more and more communities of limited English
          proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the "World Wide"
          portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for
          stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in
          various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide
          users as they enage with content in the various
          languages. The growth of epublishing also brings
          requirements for new features and improved typography on the

                and expanded. The group is collaborating with the
                JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a
                plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related
