        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
	<section>
	  <h3 id="benefit">The work of the Web Consortium benefits billions</h3>
	  <img src="https://www.w3.org/comm/assets/icons/magnifier.png"
	  alt="">

	  <p>We are proud to put the web standards into the web, and
	  that our work is benefitting billions. The web, which just
	  turned 33 this year, has been the ultimate tool of resilience
	  for the world as the impact of the global pandemic continues
	  to be a weighty blow to society. Perhaps the most crucial
	  role the web played during the pandemic was allowing
	  families and friends to remain connected. It has also been
	  essential in enabling remote learning, making vaccine
	  appointments, but also online shopping, and
	  entertainment. It has helped countless businesses stay afloat. All
	  of industry has been substantially aided by the web during
	  the age of Covid. By the same token, it has made it possible
	  for workers across all industries to interact if not
	  perfectly, at least in a manner that allowed most to remain
	  productive. Web access kept millions employed, no doubt
	  preventing a full-on economic depression.</p>

	  <h3 id="specs">Key figures representing our work</h3>

	  <p>W3C's work continues to be essential to
            the ways in which our world is meeting the challenge of
            the health crisis while working on the solutions for the
            web of the future.</p>
	  <p>This report highlights recent work to enhance the web and
            innovate for its growth and strength.</p>

	  <p>That work is conducted
	      by <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/">42 working
	      groups and 9 interest groups</a> which enable W3C to
	      pursue its
	      <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">mission</a>
	    through the creation of web standards, guidelines, and
	    other specifications and supporting documents.</p>

	  <p>The work of the Consortium has increased significantly
	  since our last report:
	      <a href="https://w3c.github.io/spec-dashboard/report.html">347
	      specifications</a> are in active development, 168 of
	      which aim to reach the status of W3C Recommendation (web
	      standard). W3C Recommendations and other types of
	      specifications and guidelines are published daily
	      on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">all Standards and
	      Drafts</a>.</p>

	  <h3 id="needs">Greater usage, greater needs</h3>

	  <p>As the usage of the web intensifies, the needs for web
	  technologies and web standards become greater. More
	  organizations become W3C members with requests to help with
	  their business and societal needs and we want to shepherd
	  the future of the web. We must not take the web for
	  granted. It can do more. It can be more. And it will take a
	  collaborative effort to ensure the web becomes more
	  accessible to people around the world, more secure, and can
	  function as the engine to fuel growth in key parts of
	  economy and society.</p>

          <h2 id="future-web">Future web standards</h2>

	<section>

	  <h3 id="pipeline">Identifying promising standardization
	  areas</h3>
	  <img src="https://www.w3.org/comm/assets/icons/lightbulb.png" alt="">

          <p>W3C uses a variety of mechanisms to engage community
            discussion on future Web standards: conversations with the
            Membership, liaising with other standards bodies, tracking
            the activity of thousands of participants in
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/groups/">377
            W3C community groups</a>, and hosting W3C Workshops. There
            are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team works to
            identify promising topics for standardization and
            invites public participation.</p>

	  <h3 id="workshops">W3C Workshops</h3>
	  <p><a href="/2003/08/Workshops/archive">W3C Workshops</a>
	    bring communities together around presentations, panels,
	    breakouts, and virtual "hallway" sessions to spur
	    collaboration on new work
	    areas. While <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/meetings/continuity.html#workshops">switching
	    to virtual</a> entailed a change in mode and some
	    re-setting of schedules, we committed to making
	    distributed meetings even more accessible and globally
	    participatory. We <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9142">announced</a>
	    last July that all W3C Workshops are to include standard
	    accessibility accommodations such as English captions on
	    pre-recorded presentations, real-time captioning during
	    live sessions, and ASL or other sign language where
	    possible upon request.</p>

	  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/08/Workshops/">Upcoming Workshop</a>:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/303">Workshop
	    on Interoperability in Data Spaces</a>, 3 June 2022,
	    Vienna (Austria), co-organized by W3C</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/08/Workshops/archive">W3C Workshops</a> recently completed:</p>
	  <ul>

	  </ul>

	  <h3 id="funnel">W3C strategy funnel</h3>
          <p>The <a href="/Strategy/Funnel">Strategy incubation
            pipeline</a> documents the exploration of potential new
            work in phases of
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215578">Incubation</a>
              and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215579">Evaluation</a>,
              and eventually in the
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215580">chartering</a>
            stages of new standards groups. The W3C Strategy Team's
            incubation pipeline is a GitHub Project where new area are
            issues represented by “cards” which move through the
            columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start
            in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215576">Exploration</a>
            and move towards
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2#column-215580">Chartering</a>,
            or move out of the pipeline.</p>

          <p><strong>Public input is welcome at any stage</strong> but
            particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C
            identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant
            standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and
            indicate interest in participating in its standardization,
            and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate
            scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall
            standardization process.</p>
	  <h3 id="advance">Advance notice of work in progress</h3>
	  <p>W3C may begin work on a Working Group or Interest Group
	    charter at any time. When it does, the team
	    informs the W3C Members and
	    the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/">public</a>,
	    aiming to raise awareness, even if no formal proposal is
	    yet available, and welcome feedback.</p>
	  <p>There is work in progress on charters for the following
	    groups:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2022Mar/0012.html">RDF-star

	  <p>Without changing the technical requirements, the group is
	  actively improving the work to streamline and make the

	      information that allows any agent to check the integrity
	      of the defined subject; allows to exchange private

Linked Data uses URIs as names for things that can be dereferenced to get further information, and included as links to other data.

One topic of interest is simplifying semantic interoperability across different kinds of information systems, e.g. RDBMS, CSV files, Spreadsheets, Linked Data and Property Graphs. Another topic is the role of Linked Data in relation to trust and privacy for digital dataspaces and associated marketplaces. We are also examining ideas for supporting vocabulary development across a spectrum of maturity, and use cases, requirements and techniques for operating on imperfect knowledge (i.e., subject to uncertainties), incompleteness and inconsistencies, along with many kinds of automated reasoning.</p>

	  <p>If the web is to live up to the "World Wide" portion of its name, and we are to create a web for all, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in various languages. The growth of e-publishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the web, and it is important to ensure that those changes capture the needs of local communities.</p>
	  <p>The W3C Internationalization activities pursue this goal by language enablement, developer support, and education &amp; outreach. See below for recent work. For an overview of current projects see the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/projects/">i18n project radar</a></p>

<p>Please also consider whether your organization can <strong>provide sponsorship to help us increase resources</strong> at the W3C dedicated to internationalization (see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/sponsorship/">Internationalization Initiative overview</a>), and contact Jeff Jaffe &lt;jeff@w3.org&gt;.</p>
<p>The various <strong>language enablement groups are also looking for additional participation</strong> from experts and practitioners for many languages, to contribute information to our gap analysis documents about the state of language support on the web around the world.</p>
<p>Don't forget to <strong>use the self-review checklist</strong> at FPWD and before requesting internationalization review, in order to spot internationalization concerns early enough to fix without pain. For assistance, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/review-request">Request a review</a>.</p>

	  <p>The Web
	    Consortium’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web
	    Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>, launched in 1997,
	    develops technical specifications and outreach and
	    training materials that promote awareness and

	    Accessibility
	    Initiative">WAI</abbr>’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web
	    Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> is regarded as
	    the authoritative international standard for Web
	    accessibility, and has been adopted or referenced by many
	    governments around the world.</p>

	  <p>As the complexity of the Web increases, as technologies
	    as diverse as digital publishing and virtual reality
	    converge onto the Web, the need for up-to-date
	    accessibility support in advanced technologies is
	    increasing. WAI supports
	    W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission.html#principles">Web
